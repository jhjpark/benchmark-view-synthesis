# INSERT PROJECT TITLE

In this repository, you will find all the code used for this project. This includes the Python JPEG compression and decompression found in `jpeg`, the NeRF training and inference code found in `tiny-nerf`, and the GARF training and inference code found in `tiny-garf`. The `tiny-nerf` folder includes code for both PyTorch and Tensorflow. Finally, we include `likwid` results in the `jpeg` repository for JPEG compression and decompression.

The code was retrieved from the following sources: [JPEG](https://github.com/ghallak/jpeg-python
), [NeRF TensorFlow](https://github.com/bmild/nerf), [NeRF PyTorch](https://github.com/krrish94/nerf-pytorch), [GARF](https://github.com/sfchng/Gaussian-Activated-Radiance-Fields).

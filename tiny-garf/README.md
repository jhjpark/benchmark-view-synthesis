# Tiny GARF

This folder contains the code used to run the GARF model, as described in [this](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2022/papers_ECCV/papers/136930259.pdf) paper. The code was taken from [this] (https://github.com/sfchng/Gaussian-Activated-Radiance-Fields) repository.

Each of the different activation functions are separated into a different folder, so each model can be run separately. The models use the image in the `images` folder to train. All of these files can be run by using `python [FILE]`.
